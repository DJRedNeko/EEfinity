# EEfinity
A way more extended library for Everybody Edits Offline with amazing world limits and many more.

### What does EEfinity bring to EEO?
Instead of the default (boring) ~650x450 border limit that you get on EEO, you get **NOTHING** to block you from making your worlds amazing. 
You can make **massive worlds, towers of hell, massive tycoons, simulators with hours of gameplay** and so on in EEfinity and all of it **for free**! No need to meddle for hours in JPEXS, no need to suffer trying to find the specific folder to search in in order to do something, all you do is just **use EE naturally** and you will get massive worlds.

### When are updates gonna roll out?
When I have the time to. EEfinity might be a small project, but I have a lot of school on my head.

### Downloads?
Look in the releases tab.
